# Garden

## Description
Garden is currently a Python GUI for a Pure Data patch. I will integrate these in the future.
I am still working on the audio engine as I'm not happy with the live sythesis areas.

It is intended to be used in live performance, with or without projection.
I am working on a set of unified commands fo ease of use and smooth learning curve.

Suggestions welcome.
